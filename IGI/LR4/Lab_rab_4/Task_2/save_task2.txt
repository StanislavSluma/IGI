Time _?_iS_?_ a_?_lL_?_ r_?_eL_?__?_aT_?_ive based on age and experience. When you are a child an hour is a long time to wait but a very short time when that’s all the time you are allowed on your _?_iP_?_ad!
As a teenager time goes faster the _?_mO_?_re d_?_eA_?_dlines you have and the more you procrastinate? As a young adult, you think you have forever to live and don’t appreciate the time you spend with others.
As a middle-_?_aG_?_ed adult, time flies by as _?_yO_?_u watch your children g_?_rO_?_w _?_uP_?_! And fin_?_aL_?_ly, _?_aS_?_ you get old _?_aN_?_d you have fewer resp_?_oN_?_sibilities and fewer demands on you, time slows.
You appreciate each day and are thankful you _?_aR_?_e a_?_lI_?_ve. An hour is the same amount of time for everyone yet it can feel so di_?_fF_?_erent in how it goes by ( mama )?
